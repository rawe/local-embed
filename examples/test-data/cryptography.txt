Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered by authorized parties. Ancient civilizations used simple substitution ciphers, such as the Caesar cipher which shifted each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For centuries, cryptography relied on keeping the encryption method itself secret. Modern cryptography instead uses publicly known algorithms whose security depends entirely on the secrecy of mathematical keys. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encrypting and decrypting data, making it fast and efficient for securing large volumes of information.

Asymmetric or public-key cryptography, developed in the 1970s, revolutionized secure communication by using mathematically linked key pairs. A public key can be shared openly for anyone to encrypt messages, while only the corresponding private key can decrypt them. This principle enables digital signatures, secure web browsing through HTTPS, and encrypted email. The RSA algorithm bases its security on the difficulty of factoring very large numbers, while elliptic curve cryptography achieves equivalent security with smaller keys. Quantum computing poses a potential future threat to current cryptographic methods, prompting researchers to develop post-quantum algorithms resistant to quantum attacks. Cryptography underpins virtually every digital transaction, from online banking to messaging apps to blockchain networks.
