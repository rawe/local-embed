Marie Curie (1867-1934), Polish-born French physicist and chemist, was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. She moved to Paris in 1891 to study at the Sorbonne, where she met and married physicist Pierre Curie. Together they conducted pioneering research on radioactivity, a term Marie herself coined. In 1898, the Curies discovered two new elements: polonium, named after Marie's homeland, and radium. Their painstaking work involved processing tons of pitchblende ore by hand in a poorly ventilated shed to isolate tiny quantities of radioactive material.

Marie Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize when she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Henri Becquerel for their research on radiation. After Pierre's tragic death in a road accident in 1906, Marie continued their work alone and won a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discovery of radium and polonium, making her the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences. She established mobile X-ray units during World War I, personally driving them to the front lines to help surgeons locate bullets and fractures. Curie founded the Radium Institute in Paris, which became a leading center for nuclear physics and chemistry research. She died of aplastic anemia, almost certainly caused by years of exposure to radiation. Her legacy extends beyond her scientific discoveries to her role as a trailblazer for women in science.
