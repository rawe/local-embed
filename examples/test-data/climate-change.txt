Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While natural factors such as volcanic eruptions and solar cycles have historically influenced the climate, human activities have become the dominant driver since the industrial revolution. The burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising average global temperatures. This warming effect disrupts ecosystems, accelerates ice sheet melting, and contributes to rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities worldwide.

The consequences of unchecked climate change are far-reaching. Extreme weather events including hurricanes, droughts, and heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense. Agricultural yields are declining in many regions as rainfall patterns shift and growing seasons change unpredictably. Coral reefs are bleaching at alarming rates due to ocean warming and acidification. Addressing the crisis requires a combination of strategies: transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and developing carbon capture technologies. International cooperation through agreements like the Paris Accord remains essential for coordinating the global response needed to limit warming to manageable levels.
