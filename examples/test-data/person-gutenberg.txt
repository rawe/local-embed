Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468), German inventor and craftsman, was born in the city of Mainz in the Holy Roman Empire. He is credited with inventing the movable-type printing press around 1440, a technological breakthrough that transformed the production of books and fundamentally changed the course of human civilization. Before Gutenberg, books in Europe were copied by hand or printed using carved wooden blocks, making them expensive and scarce. Gutenberg's innovation combined individually cast metal letter types, oil-based ink, and a wooden press adapted from agricultural screw presses to create a system capable of producing printed pages quickly and in large quantities.

Gutenberg's masterpiece, the Gutenberg Bible printed around 1455, demonstrated the remarkable quality his press could achieve. Approximately 180 copies were produced, and the surviving copies are among the most valuable books in the world. The printing press made books affordable for a much wider audience, accelerating the spread of literacy, education, and new ideas across Europe. It played a critical role in the Protestant Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Renaissance by enabling rapid dissemination of knowledge that had previously been confined to monasteries and universities. Gutenberg himself died in relative obscurity after losing control of his printing business in a legal dispute with his financier Johann Fust. Nevertheless, his invention is often ranked as the most important of the second millennium, having democratized access to information on an unprecedented scale.
