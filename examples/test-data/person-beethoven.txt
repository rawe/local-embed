Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827), German composer and pianist, was born in Bonn and later settled in Vienna, where he spent most of his adult life. He is widely considered one of the greatest composers in Western musical history, bridging the Classical and Romantic periods with works of unprecedented emotional depth and structural innovation. Beethoven showed prodigious musical talent from childhood, with his father pushing him relentlessly to become the next Mozart. By his mid-twenties, he had established himself in Vienna as a brilliant pianist and promising composer, earning the patronage of aristocratic music lovers.

Beethoven's most remarkable achievement was continuing to compose masterworks even as progressive hearing loss rendered him almost completely deaf by his mid-forties. His nine symphonies, particularly the Third (Eroica), Fifth, and Ninth (Choral), expanded the scale and ambition of orchestral music dramatically. The Ninth Symphony, completed in 1824 when Beethoven was profoundly deaf, introduced a choral finale setting Friedrich Schiller's "Ode to Joy," a melody later adopted as the anthem of the European Union. He also composed five piano concertos, sixteen string quartets, thirty-two piano sonatas, and one opera, Fidelio. His late string quartets are considered among the most profound chamber music ever written. Beethoven's music expressed individual struggle, triumph, and the full range of human emotion with a power and directness that influenced virtually every composer who followed him.
