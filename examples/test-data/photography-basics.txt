Photography is the art and science of capturing light to create images. Every photograph depends on three fundamental exposure settings: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO sensitivity. Aperture controls how wide the lens opens, affecting both the amount of light entering the camera and the depth of field. A wide aperture produces a shallow depth of field with a blurred background, while a narrow aperture keeps more of the scene in sharp focus. Shutter speed determines how long the sensor is exposed to light, allowing photographers to freeze fast action or create intentional motion blur.

Composition is equally important in creating compelling photographs. The rule of thirds suggests placing key subjects along imaginary gridlines that divide the frame into nine equal sections, creating more dynamic images than centering the subject. Leading lines draw the viewer's eye through the image, while framing uses natural elements like doorways or branches to direct attention. Light quality matters tremendously: soft diffused light from overcast skies flatters portraits, while the golden hour shortly after sunrise or before sunset produces warm, directional light ideal for landscapes. Understanding these technical and artistic principles gives photographers the tools to move beyond snapshots and create images with intention and impact.
