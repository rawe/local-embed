Quantum physics describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, where the rules of classical physics no longer apply. At the subatomic level, particles like electrons and photons exhibit wave-particle duality, meaning they can behave as both discrete particles and continuous waves depending on how they are observed. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle establishes that certain pairs of properties, such as position and momentum, cannot both be precisely measured simultaneously. These strange phenomena challenged the deterministic worldview of Newtonian mechanics and forced physicists to adopt probabilistic descriptions of nature.

Quantum mechanics has led to transformative technologies that underpin modern life. Semiconductors, which power every computer and smartphone, rely on quantum behavior of electrons in crystalline materials. Lasers, magnetic resonance imaging, and atomic clocks all depend on quantum principles. Current research focuses on quantum computing, which exploits superposition and entanglement to perform calculations that would take classical computers billions of years. Quantum cryptography promises unbreakable encryption based on the fundamental laws of physics. Despite its enormous practical success, quantum mechanics remains philosophically puzzling, with debates about measurement, reality, and the role of the observer continuing among physicists and philosophers alike.
