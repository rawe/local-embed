Medieval architecture spans roughly a thousand years of European building tradition, from the fall of Rome in the fifth century to the Renaissance in the fifteenth century. The Romanesque style dominated from the tenth to twelfth centuries, characterized by thick walls, rounded arches, sturdy pillars, and barrel vaults. Churches and castles built in this style conveyed solidity and permanence, with small windows creating dim interiors that reinforced a sense of sacred mystery. Monasteries served as centers of learning and preservation, and their cloistered layouts influenced civic and residential architecture throughout the period.

The Gothic style emerged in twelfth-century France and represented a dramatic structural innovation. Pointed arches distributed weight more efficiently than rounded ones, allowing walls to be thinner and taller. Flying buttresses transferred lateral forces away from walls, enabling the installation of enormous stained glass windows that flooded interiors with colored light. Ribbed vaulting created soaring ceilings that drew the eye upward, reinforcing spiritual aspiration. Cathedrals like Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartres took generations to complete and represented the collective artistic and engineering achievement of entire communities. Medieval builders worked without modern engineering calculations, relying instead on accumulated practical knowledge, geometric rules, and occasionally learning from structural failures.
