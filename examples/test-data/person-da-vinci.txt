Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), Italian polymath born in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, is widely regarded as one of the most diversely talented individuals in human history. Trained as a painter in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence, Leonardo quickly surpassed his master and went on to create some of the most iconic artworks ever produced. The Mona Lisa, with its enigmatic smile and pioneering use of sfumato technique, remains the most famous painting in the world. The Last Supper, painted on a wall of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, revolutionized narrative composition in art. His drawings, including the Vitruvian Man, demonstrate an extraordinary understanding of human anatomy and proportion.

Beyond painting, Leonardo was an inventor, scientist, engineer, and anatomist whose notebooks contain thousands of pages of observations and designs far ahead of his time. He sketched concepts for flying machines, helicopters, armored vehicles, and solar energy concentrators centuries before such technologies became feasible. His detailed anatomical drawings, based on the dissection of more than thirty human cadavers, were among the most accurate produced before modern medicine. Leonardo studied geology, optics, hydrodynamics, and botany with equal intensity, filling his notebooks with mirror-written text and meticulous illustrations. He embodies the ideal of the Renaissance man, demonstrating that artistic creativity and scientific inquiry are not separate pursuits but complementary expressions of human curiosity.
