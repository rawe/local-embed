Albert Einstein (1879-1955), German-born theoretical physicist, is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time. Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed an early fascination with mathematics and physics. In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, he published four groundbreaking papers that revolutionized physics. These included his special theory of relativity, which introduced the famous equation E=mc² establishing the equivalence of mass and energy, and his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which provided key evidence for quantum theory. This remarkable year became known as his annus mirabilis, or miracle year.

Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, redefined our understanding of gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory predicted phenomena later confirmed by observation, including the bending of light around massive objects, gravitational time dilation, and the existence of gravitational waves detected a century later in 2015. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, Einstein settled in the United States and took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked until his death. He became an American citizen in 1940. Beyond physics, Einstein was an outspoken advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and Zionism, and his name has become synonymous with genius in popular culture worldwide.
