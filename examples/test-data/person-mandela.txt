Nelson Mandela (1918-2013), South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and statesman, was born in the village of Mvezo in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. He studied law and became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the African National Congress in 1943. As the apartheid government imposed increasingly oppressive racial segregation laws, Mandela initially advocated nonviolent resistance before co-founding the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, in 1961. He was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for conspiracy to overthrow the state. Mandela spent twenty-seven years in prison, mostly on Robben Island, where he became the world's most famous political prisoner and a symbol of resistance against racial oppression.

Released from prison in February 1990 amid growing domestic and international pressure, Mandela led negotiations with President F.W. de Klerk to dismantle the apartheid system and establish multiracial democratic elections. Rather than seeking retribution, Mandela chose reconciliation, working to unite a deeply divided nation. In 1993, he and de Klerk jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize for their peaceful efforts to end apartheid. Mandela became South Africa's first Black president in 1994, serving until 1999. His presidency focused on transitional justice through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, economic reform, and building a new national identity. Mandela's extraordinary capacity for forgiveness after nearly three decades of imprisonment made him a global icon of moral leadership, dignity, and the enduring human capacity for grace under suffering.
