Ocean ecosystems cover more than seventy percent of Earth's surface and contain an extraordinary diversity of life. Marine environments range from sunlit coral reefs teeming with colorful fish to the pitch-black abyssal plains where bizarre creatures survive under crushing pressure. Phytoplankton, microscopic photosynthetic organisms floating near the ocean surface, produce roughly half of the world's oxygen and form the base of marine food webs. Coastal ecosystems including mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes serve as nurseries for commercially important fish species and provide natural buffers against storm surges and coastal erosion.

The health of ocean ecosystems is under significant threat from human activities. Overfishing has depleted many fish populations to dangerously low levels, disrupting food chains and threatening the livelihoods of communities that depend on the sea. Plastic pollution accumulates in massive oceanic gyres and breaks down into microplastics that enter the food chain. Ocean acidification caused by absorbed carbon dioxide weakens the shells and skeletons of corals, mollusks, and other calcifying organisms. Rising water temperatures trigger coral bleaching events and shift species distributions toward the poles. Marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and reducing pollution inputs are critical steps toward preserving these vital ecosystems for future generations.
