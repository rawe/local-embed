Alan Turing (1912-1954), British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist, was born in London, England. He is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. In 1936, Turing published his seminal paper introducing the concept of the Turing machine, an abstract mathematical model that formalized the notion of computation and algorithm. This work laid the theoretical foundation for every modern computer. The Turing machine demonstrated that a single universal device could, in principle, perform any calculation that could be described by an algorithm, establishing fundamental limits on what computers can and cannot solve.

During World War II, Turing played a pivotal role at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking center, where he led the effort to decrypt German Enigma machine communications. His work on the Bombe, an electromechanical device designed to find Enigma settings, is credited with significantly shortening the war and saving countless lives. After the war, Turing contributed to the design of early electronic computers at the National Physical Laboratory and the University of Manchester. In 1950, he proposed the Turing test as a criterion for machine intelligence, asking whether a computer could exhibit behavior indistinguishable from a human in conversation. Tragically, Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexuality, then a criminal offense in Britain, and subjected to chemical castration. He died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning in what was ruled a suicide. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous royal pardon, and he is now celebrated as a national hero.
