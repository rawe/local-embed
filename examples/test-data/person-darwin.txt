Charles Darwin (1809-1882), British naturalist and biologist, was born in Shrewsbury, England, into a wealthy and intellectual family. His grandfather Erasmus Darwin was a renowned physician and natural philosopher. After abandoning medical studies in Edinburgh and completing a degree at Cambridge, Darwin embarked on a five-year voyage aboard HMS Beagle in 1831 as the ship's naturalist. The journey took him to South America, the Galapagos Islands, Australia, and numerous other locations, where he collected specimens and made observations that would transform our understanding of life on Earth. The distinct finch species he observed on different Galapagos islands were particularly influential in shaping his ideas about how species change over time.

Darwin spent over twenty years developing and refining his theory of evolution by natural selection before publishing On the Origin of Species in 1859. The book argued that all species descend from common ancestors and that populations evolve through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits. The theory was controversial because it challenged the prevailing belief that species were fixed and individually created by God. Despite fierce initial opposition from religious authorities and some scientists, the evidence Darwin marshalled from paleontology, biogeography, embryology, and morphology proved overwhelming. Natural selection is now the unifying principle of modern biology, explaining the diversity of life from bacteria to whales. Darwin also wrote influential works on sexual selection, plant biology, and human evolution, including The Descent of Man published in 1871.
