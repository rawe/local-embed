Jazz originated in the early twentieth century in New Orleans, emerging from a rich blend of African American musical traditions including blues, ragtime, and spirituals. The genre is defined by improvisation, syncopated rhythms, and a conversational interplay between musicians. Early pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington established jazz as a serious art form, bringing it from small clubs to concert halls and international audiences. The swing era of the 1930s and 1940s made jazz the popular music of America, with big bands led by Count Basie and Benny Goodman filling dance halls across the country.

After World War II, jazz underwent rapid evolution. Bebop artists like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie pushed the music toward greater harmonic complexity and virtuosic speed, making it more of a listening experience than dance music. Miles Davis repeatedly reinvented the genre, moving from cool jazz to modal jazz to electric fusion across his career. John Coltrane explored spiritual and avant-garde directions, while artists like Herbie Hancock and Weather Report incorporated electronic instruments and funk rhythms. Today jazz continues to evolve, absorbing influences from hip-hop, world music, and electronic production while maintaining its core emphasis on spontaneous creative expression and technical mastery.
