Beekeeping, also known as apiculture, is the practice of maintaining honey bee colonies in managed hives to collect honey, beeswax, and other products while supporting pollination. A typical colony contains one queen, several hundred drones, and tens of thousands of worker bees, each performing specialized roles. The queen lays up to two thousand eggs per day, drones exist solely to mate with queens from other colonies, and workers handle foraging, nursing, building comb, guarding the hive, and regulating temperature. Beekeepers inspect hives regularly to monitor colony health, manage space, and prevent swarming, the natural process by which colonies reproduce by splitting.

Honey bees face serious challenges that have alarmed scientists and farmers worldwide. Colony collapse disorder, first widely reported in 2006, describes the sudden disappearance of worker bees from otherwise healthy hives. Contributing factors include parasitic Varroa mites that weaken bees and transmit viruses, exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides that impair navigation and immune function, habitat loss that reduces the diversity of available forage, and the stress of commercial pollination operations that truck hives across long distances. Bees pollinate roughly one-third of the food crops humans consume, making their decline an agricultural and ecological emergency. Supporting bee health through integrated pest management, planting pollinator-friendly gardens, and reducing pesticide use are practical steps individuals and communities can take.
