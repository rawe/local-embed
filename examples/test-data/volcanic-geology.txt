Volcanic geology studies how molten rock from Earth's interior reaches the surface and shapes the landscape. Volcanoes form primarily at tectonic plate boundaries where plates collide or separate, and at hotspots where plumes of unusually hot mantle material rise from deep within the Earth. When magma erupts as lava, it builds various landforms depending on its chemical composition and gas content. Low-viscosity basaltic lava flows freely and creates broad, gently sloping shield volcanoes like those in Hawaii. High-viscosity silicic magma traps gases under pressure and produces explosive eruptions that build steep-sided stratovolcanoes like Mount Fuji and Mount St. Helens.

Volcanic eruptions can have devastating local effects and significant global consequences. Pyroclastic flows, superheated mixtures of gas, ash, and rock fragments, race downhill at hundreds of kilometers per hour and destroy everything in their path. Lahars, volcanic mudflows formed when erupted material mixes with water, can bury entire valleys. Large eruptions inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, where it forms aerosol particles that reflect sunlight and temporarily cool global temperatures. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora caused the "year without a summer" across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Despite their destructive power, volcanoes also create fertile soils, generate geothermal energy, and have played a crucial role in forming Earth's atmosphere and oceans over billions of years.
