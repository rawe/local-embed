Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968), American Baptist minister and civil rights activist, was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He became the most visible spokesperson and leader of the American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968. King first gained national prominence by leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955-1956, sparked by Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. The boycott lasted 381 days and ended with the Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. King advocated for nonviolent resistance inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy, believing that peaceful protest and civil disobedience were the most powerful tools for achieving social change.

King's leadership was instrumental in landmark achievements of the civil rights era. He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech before an audience of over 250,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial. This speech, with its vision of a nation where people would be judged by their character rather than the color of their skin, remains one of the most iconic addresses in American history. King's activism contributed directly to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 at age thirty-five, making him the youngest recipient at that time. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. His birthday is observed as a federal holiday in the United States.
