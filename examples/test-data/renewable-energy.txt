Renewable energy harnesses naturally replenishing sources like sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat to generate electricity without depleting finite resources. Solar photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials, and their costs have dropped by more than ninety percent over the past decade. Wind turbines capture kinetic energy from moving air and have become a major power source in many countries, with offshore wind farms taking advantage of stronger and more consistent ocean winds. Hydroelectric dams generate power from flowing water and currently provide the largest share of renewable electricity worldwide.

The transition to renewable energy faces both technical and economic challenges. Intermittency remains a key issue since the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. Battery storage technology is advancing rapidly to address this problem, with lithium-ion and emerging solid-state batteries enabling grid-scale energy storage. Smart grid systems use software and sensors to balance supply and demand in real time. Geothermal energy taps heat from deep within the Earth and provides reliable baseload power in volcanic regions. As manufacturing scales up and technology improves, renewables are becoming cost-competitive with fossil fuels in most markets, driving a fundamental shift in how the world produces and consumes energy.
