Human nutrition is the study of how food provides the energy and building blocks the body needs to function, grow, and repair itself. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, each serving distinct roles. Carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source, broken down into glucose that fuels brain activity and muscle contraction. Proteins supply amino acids essential for building and maintaining tissues, enzymes, and immune cells. Dietary fats support hormone production, protect organs, and enable absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. A balanced diet provides these macronutrients in appropriate proportions along with adequate hydration.

Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are required in smaller quantities but are equally vital for health. Vitamin D supports calcium absorption and bone density, iron carries oxygen in red blood cells, and B vitamins participate in energy metabolism. Deficiencies in micronutrients can cause serious health problems: lack of vitamin C leads to scurvy, insufficient iodine impairs thyroid function, and iron deficiency causes anemia. Dietary fiber, found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, supports digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Nutritional science continues to evolve, with current research exploring the role of gut microbiota, the effects of ultra-processed foods, and the benefits of plant-rich dietary patterns in preventing chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
