Impressionism emerged in France during the 1860s and 1870s as a radical departure from the academic painting traditions that dominated European art. Artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro rejected the polished, highly detailed style favored by the official Salon exhibitions. Instead, they painted outdoors directly from nature, capturing fleeting effects of light and atmosphere with loose, visible brushstrokes and vibrant colors. The movement takes its name from Monet's painting "Impression, Sunrise," which a critic used mockingly to describe the group's first independent exhibition in 1874.

Impressionist techniques represented genuine innovations in how artists understood and depicted visual reality. By placing small strokes of contrasting colors side by side rather than blending them on the palette, Impressionists allowed the viewer's eye to mix colors optically, creating a luminous vibrancy impossible with traditional methods. They favored everyday subjects: bustling Parisian streets, sunlit gardens, cafe scenes, and the changing moods of rivers and coastlines. Edgar Degas focused on ballet dancers and horse racing, while Berthe Morisot portrayed intimate domestic scenes. The movement's emphasis on personal perception and direct observation opened the door for Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and ultimately the diverse explorations of modern art throughout the twentieth century.
