Aristotle (384-322 BCE), Greek philosopher and polymath, was born in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He studied at Plato's Academy in Athens for twenty years before founding his own school, the Lyceum. Aristotle served as tutor to the young Alexander the Great, shaping the mind of one of history's most powerful conquerors. His intellectual contributions span an extraordinary range of disciplines including logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics, biology, and poetics. He developed the first formal system of logic, known as syllogistic reasoning, which remained the dominant framework for Western logical thought for over two thousand years.

Aristotle's method of systematic observation and classification laid the groundwork for the scientific method. He catalogued hundreds of animal species, dissected marine creatures, and made remarkably accurate observations about embryonic development. His political writings analyzed the constitutions of over one hundred Greek city-states and proposed ideas about governance, citizenship, and justice that continue to influence political philosophy. His Nicomachean Ethics explored the concept of eudaimonia, or human flourishing, arguing that virtue lies in finding the mean between extremes. Although many of his scientific conclusions were later overturned, Aristotle's emphasis on empirical inquiry and logical reasoning established foundational principles that shaped Western philosophy, science, and education for millennia.
