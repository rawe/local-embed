Ancient Rome grew from a small settlement on the banks of the Tiber River into one of the most powerful civilizations in history. Founded traditionally in 753 BCE, Rome evolved from a monarchy to a republic and eventually an empire that controlled vast territories across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Roman engineering achievements, including aqueducts, roads, and concrete construction, enabled the empire to sustain large urban populations and move armies efficiently across great distances. The Roman legal system established principles of justice, property rights, and civic duty that continue to influence modern law.

At its height in the second century CE, the Roman Empire encompassed roughly five million square kilometers and governed an estimated seventy million people. Roman culture blended influences from Greece, Egypt, and other conquered territories, producing advances in literature, philosophy, and public administration. The empire's decline was gradual, driven by economic instability, military overextension, political corruption, and pressure from migrating Germanic tribes. The western half fell in 476 CE, while the eastern Byzantine Empire persisted for nearly another thousand years. Rome's legacy endures in modern languages, architecture, governance, and the concept of citizenship itself.
